"""
Post-rewrite sanity gate for the app and its generated data files.

The weekly roster workflows regenerate the officeholder rosters under
data/app/*.json (scripts/build_il_roster.py, build_cpd_roster.py) and open a
PR. Those builders validate their *input* (they refuse an incomplete roster),
but this script is the *output*-side gate: run it after any regeneration and
before opening a PR to confirm the app and its data are still coherent.

Before the P0 externalization these datasets were spliced into object literals
inside index.html and the risk was a mis-anchored regex dropping live code.
Now the builders emit plain JSON with json.dump (no splice, no escaping), so the
checks here are: index.html still parses and carries every layer, it no longer
embeds any dataset inline, and every app-data file is present and well formed.

Checks (all must pass; exits non-zero on the first failure):
  1. The main inline <script> still parses (`node --check`).
  2. registerLayer( appears at least as many times as expected.
  3. index.html embeds no dataset inline (no `JSON.parse('...')` blobs remain)
     and references each data/app/* file it fetches.
  4. Every expected data/app/*.json exists, parses, and has the right shape.
