Static image assets served by the app. Everything here is copied verbatim to
the published site by `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` (it ships the whole
`icons/` tree), so keep it to files the app actually uses.

## Borough seals as the selection pin

When a clicked/searched point resolves to one of the five boroughs, the plain
teardrop marker is swapped for that borough's official seal. The wiring lives in
`index.html`:

- `BOROUGH_SEAL_SLUG` maps each `boroname` (from
  `data/app/borough-boundaries.json`) to its folder here.
- `boroughSealIcon(slug)` builds the Leaflet marker from
  `boroughs/<slug>/seal-96.png`.
- `applyBoroughMarker(...)` reuses the cached borough-boundary geometry and the
  shared `pointInGeometry` test to pick the borough, then upgrades the marker.
  Water / outside-NYC clicks match no borough and keep the teardrop.

To use a different seal size for the marker, change the `seal-96.png` reference
in `boroughSealIcon`.

## Water marker (NYC Ferry logo)

A point that matches no borough is on the water, and gets the NYC Ferry logo
instead of a seal. `loadWaterFerryIcon()` in `index.html` preloads
`app/ferry.png` and only swaps it in once it actually loads — if the file is
absent the marker cleanly stays the default teardrop rather than showing a
broken image. Drop the logo in at `icons/app/ferry.png` (square, transparent or
matching background) to enable it.
